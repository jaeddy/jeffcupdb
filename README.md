# Jefferson Cup DB

This codebase was forked from [**espn-ffb**](https://gitlab.com/raphattack/espn-ffb) by @raphattack. **espn-ffb** is a project to query fantasy football data from ESPN's API and persist it in your own database. There is a very basic web component with a few views built using Flask that allows you to self-host your own fantasy football league page for things such as historical records, weekly recaps, etc.

The Jefferson Cup is a long running fantasy league among UVA alumns and friends. This project builds on and customizes the **espn-ffb** application to provide an interactive interface for exploring current and historical Jeff Cup league data.

*This repo will be evolving dramatically over the next several weeks/months â€” better documentation for usage and contribution should follow.*
